- **Use proper fuses** and circuit protection
- **Follow electrical codes** for your jurisdiction
- **Test connections** before applying full power

### Software Security

- **Keep firmware updated** to the latest version
- **Use secure communication** for remote access features
- **Validate input data** from sensors and user interfaces
- **Implement proper error handling** for safety-critical functions

### Physical Security

- **Secure mounting** of all components
- **Protect wiring** from damage and moisture
- **Use appropriate enclosures** for electronic components
- **Consider theft prevention** for expensive components
